## Welcome to the Ripple Community 🎊 

One of the best way to learn a new programming language or framework is to build something with what you are learning and also a key quality every organization wants in a developer is team work.
Here in Ripple Community, we want to create a safe space for developers and non-developers to collaborate and build solutions to real world problems using what they know.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
